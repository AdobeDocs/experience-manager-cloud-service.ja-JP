# AEM Headless Content Author Journey {#aem-headless-author-journey}

Start here for a guided journey through the powerful and flexible headless features of AEM, and how to author content for your headless project.

## はじめに {#introduction}

Headless implementation is becoming increasingly important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel.

Headless content is not based on the traditional structure of pages, and components. Instead it is based on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery.

In AEM this is realized with Content Fragments. You author the content in individual Content Fragments that are then made available for an application to select and use as required.

This flexibility means that headless is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing digital experiences.

このガイドでは、最も重要なトピックを順を追って説明します。完了時には次ができるようになります。

* Have a basic understanding of what headless content delivery is and its benefits.
* AEM ヘッドレス機能と、それらが連携してヘッドレスなエクスペリエンスを提供する仕組みを理解する。
* Have the ability to author content for your AEM headless project.

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[](/help/journey-documentation/documentation-journeys.md)

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe&#39;s latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

[](/help/journey-documentation/documentation-journeys.md)

## 対象者 {#audience}

This journey is designed for the Content Author persona. As a Content Author you will be creating the actual content in Content Fragments.

The journey lays out the requirements, steps, and approach for authoring content for an AEM Headless project. The journey will define additional personas with which the author must interact for a successful project, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the content author.

このジャーニーの情報は、もちろん他のペルソナにとっても役に立ちますが、特定のロールには必要ない情報も一部あります。その他のロールに対応するジャーニーが今後公開され次第、随時お知らせします。

## The Headless Content Author Journey {#the-journey}

このジャーニーでは、多くのトピックを参照します。以下の記事では、AEM でのヘッドレスに関する基本的な知識と、詳細な技術ドキュメントへのリンクを示します。

ジャーニーの特定の部分に直接移動することはできますが、多くの概念はそれ以前の記事の概念に基づいて構築されています。したがって、AEM でヘッドレスを初めて使用する場合は、最初から順に進めていくことをお勧めします。

### Choose Your Own Adventure {#choose-your-path}

However, Adobe wants you to succeed as you get started with your AEM Headless project, regardless of your learning style. So please consider these two options.

* If you prefer to continue to **learn about headless concepts and AEM's headless technologies**, you should continue your AEM headless journey as recommended by next reviewing the document [How to Model Your Content as AEM Content Models](model-your-content.md) where you learn how to model your content structure in AEM.
* If you prefer to **learn by doing**, you can jump to the [Getting Started with AEM Headless hands-on tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/graphql/multi-step/overview.html) where you will jump directly into AEM Headless development by implementing a simple project to expose AEM headless content.

## その他のリソース {#additional-resources}

Documentation journeys show you how AEM solves a business problem by providing a narrative that guides you through complex, interrelated processes and features. A journey illustrates how multiple features work together to serve a single business need.

As such journeys are designed to stand on their own. However a number of them can be related to each other. Check out these additional journeys for more information on how AEM&#39;s powerful features work together.
