# AEM Assets as a Cloud Service の設定と管理 {#config-administer-assets-cloud-service}

ここでは、Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service の使用開始に必要な主要な設定または管理タスクを示します。

<!-- SCOPE 

Top-level page for all administrative tasks specific to Assets as a Cloud Service.
Backlink to Sites administering content where required.
Some idea is at https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/assets/using/assets.html though not complete and not so accurate.

* How to monitor health of services
* How to see the running statuses
* How to get service-level reports like usage, performance, uptime, etc.
* Enable asset download by configuring the download servlet. It is disbaled to prevent DDOS kind of situations.
* Configure SMTP to enable email notifications.
* Configure search index and visual search's separate index.
* Cloud Manager usage, if any that’s relevant here.
* Steps to integrate with Adobe and third-party solutions. Analytics, Launch, Creative Cloud, etc.
-->

<!-- 
## Work with search indices {#search-index-for-assets-cloud-service}

* Link to this topic for information about Experience Manager's common index https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs/experience-manager-cloud-service-prerelease.en/blob/master/help/sites/operations/indexing.html
* Does Assets as a Cloud Service use a separate index for DAM? If yes, document it here.
* How does indexing work for search-focused operations like searching via AAL, DA, etc.
* What about the separate index required for Visual Search functionality? See https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/assets/using/search-assets.html#configvisualsearch.
